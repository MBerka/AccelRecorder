This project contains PCB and firmware files for the AccelRecorder wearable, capable of recording tri-axial accelerations or, with firmware adjustments, communicating with a combined accelerometer/gyroscope chip. The byte-encoded output of the firmware can be parsed and interpreted with the PC-side software of the AccelPanel repository.

The Eagle files in /PCB that can be etched chemically via toner transfer, or exported for commercial PCB manufacturing.

The C project was written and compiled through Atmel Studio 7. Compiled binaries are available in /Hardware/Debug.
